Users first go through the song and \"tap\" the beat. They then enter the lyrics through a song and the script will automatically create a new text layer for each word that starts at the correct point to the song. I also made the script compatible with another script, TypeMonkey. Using both of these, anyone can create a full typography music video in 20 minutes. I sold the exclusive hosting rights of the script to aetuts, so it is not open source or currently available.",
