I really enjoy the animating part of the process but don't particularly enjoy creating hundereds of layers and individually syncing them to the song. AudioSyncR solves this issue. Users first go through the song and \"tap\" the beat. They then enter the lyrics through a song and the script will automatically create a new text layer for each word that starts at the correct point to the song. I also made the script compatible with another script, TypeMonkey. Using both of these, anyone can create a full typography music video in 20 minutes. I sold the exclusive hosting rights of the script to aetuts, so it is not open source or currently available.",
